# NX

::: danger
I experienced some issues with gradle tasks in NX.

In particular, [flaky tasks](https://nx.dev/ci/features/flaky-tasks) happened
randomly, sometimes breaking CI

(The gradle task failed, but succeded on the second run).

Wasn't able to pinpoint the issue, needs more investigation.
:::

Some info about NX in this project.

## Configuration

In the root `nx.json`, added base caching for common tasks

```json
"targetDefaults": {
  "lint": {
    "cache": true
  },
  "fix": {
    "cache": true
  },
  "test": {
    "cache": true
  },
  "build": {
    "cache": true
  },
  ...
}
```

## Common Tasks

In order to allow running common tasks across all the projects in the repo like
`nx run-many -t lint` every project must provide a task from its `project.json`
file.

Some tasks are implicit:

- task `test` is automatically provided by the `@nrwl/jest` plugin if a project has a `jest.config`` file in it
- gradle tasks are automatically provided by the `@nx/gradle` plugin

As with every other task, we can override the base command or provide it if it's not present.

```json
{
  "name": "smispi",
  "$schema": "../../node_modules/nx/schemas/project-schema.json",
  "root": "libs/smispi",
  "projectType": "library",
  "targets": {
    "lint": {
      "executor": "nx:run-commands",
      "options": {
        "command": "./gradlew :libs:smispi:check"
      }
    },
    "fix": {
      "executor": "nx:run-commands",
      "options": {
        "command": "./gradlew :libs:smispi:fix"
      }
    },
  }
}
```

## Cache

Further caching improvements can be made by modifying the `nx.json` file or
specifying additional configs to `project.json` files.

::: warning
Caching is fragile and can lead to unexpected results like outdated dependencies and artifacts.

Make sure to configure it propery and test it thoroughly.

Refer to documentation for more info.

## Depends on and implicit dependencies

The `dependsOn` property in the `project.json` file allows us to specify which
other commands must be run before a specific task is executed.

```json
{
  "name": "jakarta-base-rest",
  "$schema": "../../node_modules/nx/schemas/project-schema.json",
  "root": "libs/jakarta-base-rest",
  "projectType": "library",
  "targets": {
    "prepare-env": {
      "executor": "nx:run-commands",
      "options": {
        "command": "mkdir -p dist/libs/jakarta-base-rest"
      }
    },
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["prepare-env"],
      "executor": "nx:run-commands",
      "options": {
        "command": "./gradlew :libs:jakarta-base-rest:buildWar && cp libs/jakarta-base-rest/build/libs/jakarta-base-rest.war dist/libs/jakarta-base-rest/"
      }
    },
  }
}
```

---
::: tip
`dependsOn` can be a task from another project in the repo.
:::
```json
{
  "name": "jakarta-base-rest-e2e",
  "$schema": "../../node_modules/nx/schemas/project-schema.json",
  "root": "libs/jakarta-base-rest-e2e",
  "implicitDependencies": ["jakarta-base-rest"],
  "projectType": "library",
  "targets": {
    "e2e": {
      "executor": "@nx/jest:jest",
      "outputs": ["{workspaceRoot}/coverage/{e2eProjectRoot}"],
      "options": {
        "jestConfig": "libs/jakarta-base-rest-e2e/jest.config.ts",
        "passWithNoTests": true
      },
      "dependsOn": ["jakarta-base-rest:build"]
    },
  }
}
```
---

The `implicitDependencies` property in the `project.json` file allows us to specify manually which project is linked as a dependency to the current target.

This allows `nx affected` to work correctly.

```json
{
  "name": "jakarta-base-rest-e2e",
  "$schema": "../../node_modules/nx/schemas/project-schema.json",
  "root": "libs/jakarta-base-rest-e2e",
  "implicitDependencies": ["jakarta-base-rest"],
  "projectType": "library",
  "targets": {
   ...
  }
}
```

## Release

Nx, as reported in the documentation, provides 3 commands to release a project:

- `nx release version`
- `nx release changelog`
- `nx release publish`

and a fourth command to automate the whole process:

- `nx release`

The configuration for the release is in the `nx.json` file:

```json
  "release": {
    "projects": ["*", "!*-e2e", "root"],
    "version": {
      "conventionalCommits": true
    },
    "changelog": {
      "workspaceChangelog": {
        "file": false,
        "createRelease": "github"
      },
      "projectChangelogs": {
        "renderOptions": {
          "authors": true,
          "commitReferences": true,
          "versionTitleDate": true
        }
      }
    }
  }
```

**`nx release publish`** has as default behavior `npm publish` for all the
projects in the repo with a `package.json` file containing `private: false`.

We can override this behavior in the project `project.json` file:

```json
{
  "name": "smispi",
  "$schema": "../../node_modules/nx/schemas/project-schema.json",
  "root": "libs/smispi",
  "projectType": "library",
  "targets": {
    "nx-release-publish": {
      "command": "./gradlew :libs:smispi:publishAndReleaseToMavenCentral --no-configuration-cache"
    }
  }
}
```
